# Creating a bundle

In this setup, `index.js` explicitly requires `lodash` to be present, and bind it as `_` (no global scope pollution). By stating what dependencies a module needs, webpack can use this information to build a dependency graph. It then uses the graph to generate an optimized bundle where scripts will be executed in the correct order.

## How to use
With that said, let's run `npx webpack` with our script as the [entry point](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/) and `bundle.js` as the [output](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/output). The `npx` command, which ships with Node 8.2 or higher, runs the webpack binary (`./node_modules/.bin/webpack`) of the webpack package we installed in the beginning.

```
npx webpack src/index.js dist/bundle.js

```

Open `index.html` in your browser and, if everything went right, you should see the following: 'Hello webpack'.
